# Get involved
If you are missing a feature in the convention, something is unclear and requires better documentation or you have a better solution for a current feature, get involved.

Open a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/homieiot/convention/issues) to start a discussion about a new feature.

Open a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/homieiot/convention/pulls) to provide a change to the convention and have it discussed.

**![Rolling Release](https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/thesquid-ink-40-free-flat-icon-pack/64/traffic-light-20.png) The Homie Convention follows the rolling release model and is improved and released in short development cycles. Check the [*releases*](https://github.com/homieiot/convention/releases) tab to learn about previous release versions.**

## How is a new feature proposal handled?

* A new discussion/feature can be raised by a GitHub Issue or a Pull-Request. A Pull Request is preferred, as it allows to talk about a specific idea more easily.
* The discussion period for a new feature lasts for a maximum of 3 weeks. Everyone involved can apply for a longer time frame if required. 3 weeks no progress means "Rejected" automatically.
* Active maintainers list themselves in a MAINTAINER.md file. Everyone in that file is required to response within 3 weeks to a feature request. A maintainer can remove/add himself at any time to the mentioned file if workload/holiday will prevent him participating in a foreseeable future.
* All active maintainers MUST agree on a new feature for it to be added. An exception is the trivial case (spelling error, ...) in which a single maintainer is sufficient.

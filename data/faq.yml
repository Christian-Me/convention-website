    question: How do I query/request a property?
    answer: |
      You don't.
      The MQTT protocol does not implement the request-reply but rather the publish-subscribe messaging pattern.
      The Homie convention follows the publish-subscribe principle by publishing data as retained messages on a regular basis.
      You might want to rethink the design of your application - in most scenarios a regularly updated information is sufficient.

      *Workaround:* You are free to implement your own ideas on top of the basic structure of the Homie convention.
      You could either implement a `get` getter topic and its logic to trigger a value update, or you may exploit the concept of Homie properties and define a settable property to trigger a value update.
